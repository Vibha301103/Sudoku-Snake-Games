## 1.  Snake Game

A simple terminal-based Snake Game implemented in C++.

###  Features:
- Snake movement using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys
- Random food generation
- Snake grows after eating food
- Score tracking
- Game over on wall or self collision

###  File:
- `Snake/game.cpp`

###  How to Compile & Run:
```bash
g++ Snake/game.cpp -o snake
./snake

## 2.  Sudoku Solver

A backtracking-based Sudoku solver that solves a 9x9 puzzle using recursion.

Features:
Backtracking algorithm

Checks rows, columns, and 3Ã—3 subgrids for constraints

Efficient and recursive implementation

 File:
Sudoku/main.cpp
